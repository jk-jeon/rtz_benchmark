# Benchmark for trailing zero removal

This repo is for benchmarking various trailing zero removal algorithms for their uses in [Dragonbox](https://github.com/jk-jeon/dragonbox).

Here is the benchmark result I got (on 04/20/2024, on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz, Windows 10 Laptop):

- 32-bit benchmark for numbers with at most 8 digits.

**Notes.**
- Samples are randomly generated by the following procedure:
  - Uniformly randomly generate the number of total digits, from 1 to the prescribed maximum number of digits.
  - Given the number of total digits, uniformly randomly generate the number of trailing zeros, from 0 to the number of total digits minus 1.
  - Given the number of total digits and the number of trailing zeros, uniformly randomly generate an unsigned integer.
- Algorithms without any suffix remove trailing zeros one by one.
- Algorithms with "2-1" suffix remove two consecutive trailing zeros first, and then remove one more zero if needed.
- Algorithms with "8-2-1" suffix first try to see if the input has at least eight trailing zeros (using the corresponding divisibility check algorithm), and if that is the case, then remove eight zeros and call the 32-bit "2-1" variants of themselves. If there are less than eight trailing zeros, then they proceed as their "2-1" variants.
